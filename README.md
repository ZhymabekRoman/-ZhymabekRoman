## I'm Zhymabek Roman - open source enthusiast, ❤️ GNU/Linux. 

I'm a pretty busy person. If you don't have serious problems and/or haven't tried to solve them on your own, don't write to me. If you really need my help, get me to drop all my other cases. If you think I owe you something - you are mistaken. If you ignore the above - don't be surprised if I ignore you
